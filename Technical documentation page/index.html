          <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive."<br>
            The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
            right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.<br>
            Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special
            preparation or compilation to run.<br>
            In this aspect, JavaScript is very different fron another language called
            Java.
            <blockquote>
              <h2>Why is it called JavaScript?</h2>
              <p>
                When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript".
                But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning
                a new language as a "younger brother" of java could help.<br>
                But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its
                own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at 
                all.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server,
            or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
