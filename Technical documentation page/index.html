        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive."<br>
          The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
          right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.<br>
          Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need
          special preparation or compilation to run.<br>
          In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
          called Java.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Why is it called JavaScript?</h3>
          <p>
            When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
            "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
            decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of
            java could help.<br>
            But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
            with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no
            relation to Java at all.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the
          server, or actually on any device that has a special program called
          the JavaScript engine.
        </p>
        <h2>What makes JavaScript unique?</h2>
        <p>There are at least three great things about JavaScript:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple integration with HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Simple things are done simply.</li>
            <li>Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three
          things.<br>
          That's what makes JavaScript unique. That's why it's the most
          widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.<br>
          That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile
          applications, etc.
        </p>
      </section>
      <!-- Hello world -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>
          <h1>Hello world</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>The "script" tag</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML
          document using the &lt;script&gt; tag.<br>
          For instance:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;

            &lt;html&gt;

            &lt;body&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Before the script ...&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;script&gt;

            alert( 'Hello, world!' );

            &lt;/script&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;... After the script.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/body&gt;

            &lt;/html&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The &lt;script&gt; tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically
          executed when the browser processes the tag.
        </p>
      </section>
      <!-- Code structure -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Code_structure">
        <header>
          <h1>Code structure</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Statements</h2>
        <p>
          Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
          <br>
          We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can
          be separated with a semicolon.<br>
          For example, here we split "Hello World" into two alerts:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            alert('Hello'); alert('World');
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code
          more readable:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            alert('Hello');
            alert('World');
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Semicolons</h2>
        <p>
          A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
          <br>
          This would also work:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            alert('Hello')
            alert('World')
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an "implicit" semicolon.
          This is called an <i>automatic semicolon insertion</i>.
          <br>
          <strong
            >In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But "in most cases"
            does not mean "always"!</strong
          >
        </p>
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
          As time goes on, programs becomes more and more complex. It becomes
          necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and
          why.<br>
          Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its
          execution because the engine simply ignores them.<br>
          <strong
            >One-line comments starts with two forward slash characters
            //</strong
          >.<br>
          The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its
          own or follow a statement.<br>
          like here:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            // This comment occupies a line of its own
            alert('Hello');
            alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /*
            and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */. </strong
          ><br>
          The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside /* .. */,
          it won't execute.<br>
          Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            /* An example with two messages.
            This is a multiline comment.
            */
            alert('Hello');
            alert('World');

            /* Commenting out the code
            alert('Hello');
            */
            alert('World');
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <!-- variables -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>
          <h1>Variables</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>A variable</h2>
        <p>
          A variable is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to
          store goodies, visitors, and other data.<br>
          To create a variable in JavaScript, use the
          <strong>let</strong> keyword.<br>
          The statement below creates (in other word: declares) a variable with
          the name "message":
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let message;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator = :
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let message;

            message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the
          variable. We can access it using the variable name:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let message;
            message = 'Hello!';

            alert(message); // shows the variable content
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment
          into a single line:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

            alert(message); // Hello!
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Variable naming</h2>
        <p>There are two limitation on variable name in JavaScript:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the $ and _ .</li>
          <li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Examples of valid names:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let userName;
            let test123;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used.
          That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting
          with a capital letter: <strong>myVeryLongName</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Case matters</h3>
          <p>
            Variable named <strong>apple</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>
            are two different variables.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Constants</h2>
        <p>
          To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use
          <strong>const </strong> instead of <strong>let</strong>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Variables declared using <strong>const</strong> are called
          "constants". They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would
          cause an error:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

            myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          When a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can
          declare it with <strong>const</strong> to guarantee and communicate
          that fact to everyone.
        </p>
      </section>
      <!-- Data types -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>
          <h1>Data types</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a
          string or a number.<br>
          We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one
          moment be a string and then store a number.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            // no error
            let message = "hello";
            message = 123456;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are
          called "dynamically typed", meaning that there exist data types , but
          variables are not bound to any of them.
        </p>
        <h2>Number</h2>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let n = 123;
            n = 12.345;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
          <br>
          There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division
          /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
        </p>
        <h2>String</h2>
        <p>A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let str = "Hello";
            let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
            let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Boolean (logical type)</h2>
        <p>
          The boolean type has two values: true or false.<br>
          This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means "yes,
          correct", and false means "no, incorrect".<br>
          For instance:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
            let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let isGreater = 4 &gt; 1;
            alert(isGreater); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>The "null" value</h2>
        <p>
          The special null value does not belong to any of the types describes
          above.<br>
          It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null
          value:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let age = null;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, null is not a "reference to a non-existing object" or a
          "null pointer" like in some other languages.<br>
          It's just a special value which represents "nothing", "empty" or
          "value unknown".<br>
          The code above states that age is unknown.
        </p>
        <h2>The "undefined" value</h2>
        <p>
          The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its
          own, just line null.<br>
          The meaning of undefined is "value is not assigned".<br>
          If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is
          undefined:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let age;
            alert(age); // show "undefined"
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a
          variable;
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let age = 100;

            // change the value to undefined
            age = undefined;

            alert(age); // "undefined"
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          ...But we don't recommend doing that. Normally, one uses null to
          assign an "empty" or "unknown" value to a variable , while undefined
          is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.

        <p>
          Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different
          conditions.<br>
          To do that, we can use the if statement and the conditional operator
          ?, that's also called a "question mark" operator.
        </p>
        <h1>The "if" statement</h1>
        <p>
          The if (...) statement evaluates a condition in parenthesis and, if
          the result is true, executes a block of code.<br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

            if (year == 2015) alert( 'you are right!');
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the condition is a simple equality check (year
          == 2015), but it can be much complex.<br>
          If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our
          code block inside curly braces:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            if (year == 2015) {
            alert( "That's correct!");
            alert( "You're so smart!");
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We recommend wrapping your code block with curly braces {} every time
          you use an if statement, even if there is only one statement to
          execute. Doing so improves readability.
        </p>
        <h2>Boolean conversion</h2>
        <p>
          The if {...} statement evaluates the expression in its parenthesis and
          converts the result to a boolean.<br>
          conversion rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all becomes
            false. Because of that they are called "falsy" values.
          </li>
          <li>Other values becomes true, so they are called "truthy".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the code under this condition would never execute:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            if (0) { // 0 is falsy
            ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>...and inside this condition - it always will:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            if (1) { // 1 is truthy
            ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>We can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to if, like this:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let cond = (year == 2015); //equality evaluates to true or false

            if (cond) {
            ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>The "else" clause</h2>
        <p>
          The if statement may contain an optional else block. It executes when
          the condition is falsy.<br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

            if (year == 2015) {
            alert( 'You guessed it right!' );
            } else {
            alert( 'How can you be so wrong?' ); // any value except 2015
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Several conditions: "else if"</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we'd like to test several variants of a condition. The else
          if clause lets us do that.<br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let year = prompt('In which was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

            if (year &lt; 2015) {
            alert( 'Too early...' );
            } else if (year &gt; 2015) {
            alert( 'Too late' );
            } else {
            alert ( 'Exactly' );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the code above, JavaScript first checks year &lt; 2015. If that is
          falsy, it goes to the next condition year &gt; 2015. If that is also
          falsy, it shows the last alert.<br>
          There can be more else if blocks. The final else is optional.
        </p>
        <h2>Conditional operator '?'</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.
          <br>
          For instance:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let accessAllowed;
            let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

            if (age &gt; 18) {
            allowedAccess = true;
            } else {
            accessAllowed = false;
            }

            alert(accessAllowed);
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The so-called "conditional" or "question mark" operator lets us do
          that in a shorter and simpler way.<br>
          The operator is represented by a question mark ?. Sometimes it's
          called "ternary", because the operator has three operands. It is
          actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that
          many.<br>
          The syntax is:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The condition is evaluated: if it's truthy then value1 is returned,
          otherwise value2.<br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let accessAllowed = (age &gt; 18) ? true : false;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Technically, we can omit the parenthesis round age &gt; 18. The
          question mark operator has a low precedence, so it executes after the
          comparison &gt;.
        </p>

      <!-- Loops -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>
          <h1>Loops</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          We often need to repeat actions<br>
          For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just
          running the same code for each number from 1 to 10.<br>
          Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.
        </p>
        <h2>The "while" loop</h2>
        <p>The while loop has the following syntax:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            while (condition) {
            // code
            // so-called "loop body"
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          While the condition is truthy, the code from the loop body is
          executed.<br>
          For instance, the loop below outputs i while i &lt; 3:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let i = 0;
            while (i &lt; 3) {// show 0, then 1, then 2
            alert(i);
            i++;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>The "do...while" loop</h2>
        <p>
          The condition check can be moved below the loop body using the
          do..while syntax:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            do {
            // loop body
            } while (condition);
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and,
          while it's truthy, execute it again and again.<br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let i = 0;
            do {
            alert( i );
            i++;
            } while (i &lt; 3);
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the
          loop to execute <strong>at least once</strong> regardless of the
          condition being truthy. Usually. the other form is preferred:
          while(...) {...}.
        </p>
        <h2>The "for" loop</h2>
        <p>
          The for loop is more complex, but it's also the most commonly used
          loop.<br>
          It looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            for (begin; condition; step) {
            // ... loop body ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Let's learn the meaning of these parts by example. The loop below runs
          alert(i) for i from 0 up to (but not including) 3:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) { // show 0, then 1, then 2 alert(i); } </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <!-- Functions -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>
          <h1>Functions</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the
          script.<br>
          For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor
          logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.<br>
          Functions are the main "building blocks" of the program. They allow
          the code to be called many times without repetition.
        </p>
        <h2>Function Declaration</h2>
        <p>
          To create a function we can use a function declaration.<br>
          It looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function showMessage() {
            alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The function keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function,
          then a list of parameters between the parenthesis (comma-separated,
          empty in the example above, we'll see examples later) and finally the
          code of the function, also named "the function body", between curly
          braces.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function name(parameter1, parameter2, .... parameterN) {
            // body
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Our new function can be called by its name: showMessage().<br>
          For instance:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function showMessage() {
            alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
            }

            showMessage();
            showMessage();
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The call showMessage() executes the code of the function. Here we will
          see the message two times.<br>
          This example clearly demonstrates one of the main purposes of
          functions: to avoid code duplication.<br>
          If we ever need to change the message or the way it is shown, it's
          enough to modify the code in one place: the function which outputs it.
        </p>
        <h2>Local variables</h2>
        <p>
          A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that
          function.<br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function showMessage() {
            let message = "Hello, I'm Javascript"; //local variable

            alert( message );
            }

            showMessage(); // Hello, I'm Javascript!

            alert( message ); // &lt;-- Error! The variable is local to the function
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Outer variables</h2>
        <p>A function can access an outer variable as well, for example:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let userName = 'john';

            function showMessage() {
            let message = 'Hello, ' + userName;
            alert(message);
            }

            showMessage(); // Hello, john
          </code>
        </pre>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Global Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Variables declared outside of any function, such as the outer
            userName in the code above, are called global.<br>
            Global variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by
            locals).<br>
            It's good practice to minimize the use of global variables. Modern
            code has few or no globals. Most variables reside in their
            functions. sometimes though, they can be useful to store
            project-level data.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Parameter</h2>
        <p>
          we can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters.<br>
          In the example below, the function has two parameters: from and text.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function showMessage(from, text) { // parameter: from, text
            alert(from + ': ' + text);
            }

            showMessage('Ann', 'Hello!'); // Ann: Hello (*)
            showMessage('Ann', "What's up?"); // Ann: what's up? (**)
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          When the function is called in lines (*) and (**), the given values
          are copied to local Variables from and text. Then the function uses
          them.
        </p>
        <h2>Default values</h2>
        <p>
          If a function is called, but an argument is not provided, then the
          corresponding value becomes undefined.<br>
          For instance, the aforementioned function showMessage(from, text) can
          be called with a single argument:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            showMessage("Ann");
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          That's not an error. Such a call would output "*Ann": undefined. As
          the value for text isn't passed, it becomes undefined.<br>
          We can specify the so-called "default" (to use if omitted) value for a
          parameter in the function declaration, using =:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function showMessage(from, text = "no text given") {
            alert( from + ": " + text );
            }

            showMessage("Ann"); // Ann: no text given
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Returning a value</h2>
        <p>
          A function can return a value back into the calling code as the
          result.<br>
          The simplest example would be a function that sum two values:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function sum(a, b) {
            return a + b;
            }

            let result = sum(1, 2);
            alert( result ); // 3
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The directive return can be in any place of the function. When the
          execution reaches it, the function stops, and the value is returned to
          the calling code (assigned to result above).
        </p>
        <h2>Naming a function</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are actions. so their name is usually a verb. It should be
          brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so
          that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function
          does.<br>
          It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix
          which vaguely describe the action. There must be an agreement within
          the team on the meaning of the prefixes.<br>
          For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show
          something.<br>
          Function starting with...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"get..." - return a value,</li>
          <li>"calc..." - calculate something</li>
          <li>"create..." - create something</li>
          <li>"check..." - check something and return a boolean, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of such names:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            showMessage(..) // shows a message
            getAge(..) // returns the age (gets it somehow)
            calcSum(..) // calculates a sum and returns the result
            createForm(..) // creates a form (and usually returns it)
            checkPermission(..) // checks a permission, returns true/false
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an
          understanding what kind of work it does and what kind of value it
          returns.
